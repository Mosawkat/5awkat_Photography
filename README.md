# 5awkat_Photography
Hi welcome to 5awkat_Photography page.

This site is still under construction and if you don't see any files at the time, it means they have been taken down to re-edit, and optimize for the full version of the website, which will launch very soon.

Latest Update: (December 12, 2022)
-This is Version Beta 1 for the website, as everything is being close to becoming final.
-Added intoduction to Home page, therefore the about me section will not be added as I incorporated the elements such as my camera gear and lenses into the 
main home screen.
-Porfolio Page is mostly complete, might switch around a few images for better cohesion.
-More jQuery elements were added as a toggle to see more information.

Bugs to fix:
-2 flower pictures on portfoilio (other).
-Images load slowly, try to optimize image sizes and loading.

Previous Update: (December 8th, 2022)
-This is Version Alpha 2. Still under major development.
-All files have been reuploaded with many changes.
-All image files are now properly named and easily identifiable.
-Portfolio page has been redone, where the images are now shown and hidden properly as needed.
-Portfolio.js is not being used in this version in favor of much simpler jQuery to show and hide elements.
-More jQuery functions and elements will be added as needed to make webpage more responsive and reduce clutter with code.

Previous Update: (December 6th, 2022)
-All files taken down as image files sizes were too large, so the new ones will be much smaller and more optimized.
-Major functionality is being revised as I want to keep the site simple and thus removed some features.
-Some pages will be restructured and colors and shapes will change.

Previous Update:
-Version Alpha 1.
-Website is now live with it's first ever version.
-Major image loading issues as image files are too large.
-About me still missing
-Images are not working properly as height and width must be optimized.
