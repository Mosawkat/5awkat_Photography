# 5awkat_Photography
Hi welcome to 5awkat_Photography page.

This site is still under construction and if you don't see any files at the time, it means they have been taken down to re-edit, and optimize for the full version of the website, which will launch very soon.

Lastest Update: (December 21, 2022)
-This is version Beta 3. Next version most likely to be the release.
-Fixed bug where sports images not showing due to uppercase names
-Added mobile support: (much requested)
-Index page now has a whole new layout just for mobile where my image is hidden, fonts are a little bigger, and images are laid out in a different way with index7.jpg being a mobile only image.
-Portfolio page is now dynamic from desktop to mobile:
-Portfolio page images will show one by one on mobile, and category names have been changed to emojis to make it stay same size without messing up the layout of the buttons. Desktop remains the same.
-Image loading is still a problem and will need to find ways to optimize it.


Previous Update: (December 19, 2022)
-This is version Beta 3.
-Profile picture is now a full picture with borders made circular.
-All the files have been renamed (again) as their categories and not their description. (How I should have done it from the beginning)
-There are no files more than 10MB in size.
-3 pictures in the front page has been changed.
-Portfolio, Sports and Other has some new pictures or has been restructured.
-Removed contact section as it didn't look right and had too many buttons.
-Hopefully fixed issue with buttons looking different on mobile.

Previous Update: (December 16, 2022)
-This is version Beta 2. 
-New Picture for the header.
-New Contact buttons which will show my email and phone number with the toggle buttons at the end of the Home page.
-Added some comments to the HTML sites, will add comments to the CSS and JS files as well.
-Flower picture big is fixed.
-Added some new pictures to balance out the two sides of some of the sports and portrait divs.
-Changed the font of the nav bar and added color to the text when hovering.
-The active button status now shows which button is active in the portfolio page and will deactivate other buttons when one is activated.

No bugs found outright but will continue to monitor for them and add more efficiency.
One thing I did to make pictures load much faster was instead of using the 15-30 MB files, I took a screenshot of the picture which decreases the quality but also improves the loading times, so will look to implement that in all the pictures on the website.

Previous Update: (December 12, 2022)
-This is Version Beta 1 for the website, as everything is being close to becoming final.
-Added intoduction to Home page, therefore the about me section will not be added as I incorporated the elements such as my camera gear and lenses into the 
main home screen.
-Porfolio Page is mostly complete, might switch around a few images for better cohesion.
-More jQuery elements were added as a toggle to see more information.

Bugs to fix:
-2 flower pictures on portfoilio (other).
-Images load slowly, try to optimize image sizes and loading.

Previous Update: (December 8th, 2022)
-This is Version Alpha 2. Still under major development.
-All files have been reuploaded with many changes.
-All image files are now properly named and easily identifiable.
-Portfolio page has been redone, where the images are now shown and hidden properly as needed.
-Portfolio.js is not being used in this version in favor of much simpler jQuery to show and hide elements.
-More jQuery functions and elements will be added as needed to make webpage more responsive and reduce clutter with code.

Previous Update: (December 6th, 2022)
-Version Alpha 1.
-All files taken down as image files sizes were too large, so the new ones will be much smaller and more optimized.
-Major functionality is being revised as I want to keep the site simple and thus removed some features.
-Some pages will be restructured and colors and shapes will change.

Previous Update:
-Version Pre-Alpha.
-Website is now live with it's first ever version.
-Major image loading issues as image files are too large.
-About me still missing
-Images are not working properly as height and width must be optimized.
